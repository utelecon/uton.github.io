3. When requested to update your password, enter the initial password from the notification into the “Current password” field, and enter your new password in the field marked “New password” and "Confirm password".
   - Passwords must be at least three of the following four types: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, and must be between 12 and 64 characters long. However, the ECCS printing service (printer operation panel) and the financial accounting system and budget execution management system allow passwords of up to 32 characters, so we recommend that passwords be set to 32 characters or less when using these systems.
4. When the screen titled “Permission requested” is displayed, click the “Accept” button in the lower right corner.
    - You will be redirected to a page that guides you through the initial setup procedure for multi-factor authentication. Follow the instructions to set up multi-factor authentication.
